# grpn-suboptimal

An Optimize/Bloodhound support library for NextJS/VPCS.

## Origins

This library is a reimagining "from the ground up" for Optimize Suite.

The Optimize suite [flow](https://github.groupondev.com/optimize/optimize-suite/blob/main/docs/flow_bloodhound_08_2020.png) shows a complicated stack of behaviors that got tracking info into tracky.

We intend to simplify this entire stack into Winston transports, logging as in @vpcs/grpn-next-logging, and more foolproof javascript runtimes.

## Theory

As with most other things in the stack, I expect to start from scratch and see what works and what doesn't.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test grpn-suboptimal` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
