Some choices in ECMAScript were just... not decisions I would make.
Other things in here are extremely dangerous and are substitutes for better long term solutions.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Building

Run `nx build jstk` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test jstk` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
